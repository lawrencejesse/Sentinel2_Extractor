Running SIMPLIFIED lease vs field analysis...
This compares the lease area directly to the surrounding healthy field.

Checking geometry sizes...
Field area: 102.72 hectares
Lease area: 1.43 hectares
Expected pixels at 10m resolution: Field=10271, Lease=143
Expected pixels at 30m resolution: Field=1140, Lease=15

Field (excluding lease) area: 101.28 hectares
